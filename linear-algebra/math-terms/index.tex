% List main ideas or theorems here
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{Yellow}{Commutative property}: the operation of numbers or expression of equation can be swapped or moved around and be the same
    \item Perpendicular Line : Two distinct lines intersecting each other at 90 âˆ˜ or at a right angle
    \item \textcolor{Yellow}{Transpose}: to move something from one side of an equation to another. In the equation x + 3 = 2y, you can solve for x by transposing the 3 to the other side of the equation, which will change its sign and give you x = 2y - 3.
